General idea: 1950's horror movie with giant bugs threatening a small town.

It Came From the Desert.

Incorporate 1950's (horror) movie tropes:

- Teenagers dating: the high school beauty and the school team
  quaterback, the shy science nerd who gets bullied - in the end, he
  saves the world and gets the girl
  - Making out in a car on the top of the hill, overlooking the lights
    of the town

- A mad scientist.

- Nuclear experiments in the nearby deserts.

- Small town idyll, but only superficially with lots of dirty laundry
  behind the scenes, skeletons in every closet, etc.

- American.
  - Architecture

- Constant theme throughout the game: nothing is the way it seems at
  first. Lots of unexpected twists.
  - Everybody has a secret.
    - Someone gets blackmailed by someone else who found out about the
      first person's secret.
  - Someone dies. Was it an accident or was it murder?

- What would be super cool: different rendering effects of the same
  scene - in the beginning, the town is picture book beautiful, later
  on, it is rendered in a Tim Burton kind of style, but everything
  transitions very slowly and minimally so that you might not even
  notice.

- An all-American boy. Or Goonie-like group of friends.
  - on bicycles
    - trying to be detectives

- Happy housewives
  - Apple pie
  - Hanging laundry outside

- Man of the house
  - wears a suit and tie, always
    - might replace the suit jacket with a vest or a sweater
  - grills sausages on a kugelgrill
  - watches "the game" on TV with a beer can 

- 1950's cars in the driveways

- Use Maniac Mansion's cicadas sounds at night as an hommage

- Some people love the small-town live style, others only pretend to
  love it, others clearly would want to leave in a heart beat if only
  they could.

- The farmer is an unapproachable man because he holds a grudge
  (against what?) but is actually a good person. The kids of the town
  are afraid of him.

- Bowling

- A poker night?

- A more bullying man who wants to command others around. His wife is
  unhappy. A Biff Tannon kind of guy.

- A good mayor.
